# MindfulHack-2021

### Inspiration

As we have seen different mental health issues, including insomnia, anxiety, having too much pressure, have been deteriorating these years along with the existence of COVID-19, we hope to provide an integrated platform, SciKick, for people to relieve themselves or seek help in diversified ways to prevent themselves going into the serious vicious cycle of worsening mental health. 

SciKick is an integrated mobile application for managing your mental health status.

Firstly, our homepage has two sections for users to **select their daily mood** and **sleep quality**. These have corresponded to another feature, which is "Inspiration". These data will be recorded into firebase at the end of the day, and these records can be viewed on the "Inspiration" page. On the page, you can select "Sleep Quality" and "Mood Board". In these two subpages, you can view the corresponding dashboard, professional tips and exercises. For the dashboard, these are the data dashboard for you to keep track of your own sleeping quality and mood. For the professional tips, they are external articles that help you have a better sleeping quality and better mood. Then for the exercises, there are exercises that help you fall asleep more easily, meditation with sound guidance as well as exercises that make you happier with upbeat background music!

Secondly, we have a "**Consultants**" page, in which users can chat with our professional psychiatrists and amateur consultants for advice and suggestions, or just simply find someone to talk to!

The third feature that we have implemented is "Journal" page. In the page, users can write down their thoughts and moments. They can view, edit and delete the journals afterward. This feature is just like a diary for users!
